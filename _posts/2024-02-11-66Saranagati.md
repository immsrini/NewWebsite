Adiyen shared a few notes on saranagati, as was instructed. This is an ex-tempo talk; hence, my inexperience and lack of sastra adhikaram is evident. Adiyen delivered this talk at the local Divya Prabandham Youth Forum. You can find the YouTube videoÂ [here](https://youtu.be/HS8paG20ARY).

Needless to mention, adiyen is no vedic scholar and always learning along with everyone.
